# checkpchealth
Here is a Python program that can be used to check the health of a PC running in Linux.
This program uses the os module to execute command-line commands and check the CPU, memory, and disk usage of the system. The top command is used to check CPU usage, the free command is used to check memory usage, and the df command is used to check disk usage. The program checks if the usage of each resource is above 80% and prints a message indicating whether the usage is normal or high.

You can modify this program to suit your specific needs, such as by changing the thresholds for what is considered "high" usage or by adding additional checks for other resources.
